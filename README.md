This is my university course work for database classes.

The project uses [Kaggle news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset).

The core of the project is `vna` cli.
It reads the provided **`200K+`** articles from the data source and puts them into thes [`Elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) cluster while analyzing
the obtained textual information sentiment.
The ingest process is implemented by `vna_data_sync` component.
After this process is done you can use `vna` cli to do fulltext search,
query significant words statistics and news sentiments using various `Elasticsearch`
analysis and query APIs.

# Example analytics

# Bootstrap

Deploy local `Elasticsearch` cluster of 3 data nodes on your local machine, also
spin up a `Kibana` instance with auth-less access to that cluster.
```
docker-compose up
```
The configuration tweaks for this is available in `.env` file.
You should create it similar to the provided `EXAMPLE.env` template.



// FIXME: add cli bootstrap guide once it is formed.
