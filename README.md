# news-analyzer

This is my university course work for database classes.

The project uses external APIs to collect current news, stores them
in [`Elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) cluster and analyzes
the obtained textual information using various `Elasticsearch` analysis APIs
along with other 3-d party services.
